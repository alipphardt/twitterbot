# Python Twitter-bot

This twitter bot, written in python, was developed as part of a project for a programming in data science class. Given a *term*, it searches the News API and Google RSS feed to find articles containing the given *term*. Long URLs are passed to the Bitly API for shortening. A status update with media is then posted to the given Twitter profile.

Access keys/tokens have been removed from this script. In order to get the script to work, please request developer tokens from Twitter and Bitly and modify the script appropriately. 

An example of the Twitter-bot using this script can be found at [https://twitter.com/millennialYell](https://twitter.com/millennialYell).

In order to run the script on a schedule, consider using a hosting service that supports python such as **pythonanywhere.com**. A free account may be obtained with one daily scheduled task.
